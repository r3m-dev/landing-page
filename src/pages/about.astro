  <p>
    Hey! I'm a senior software engineer who loves designing reliable systems and
    shipping products that feel great to use.
  </p>
  <p>
    I work across the stack with TypeScript, Node.js, React/Next.js, and
    PostgreSQL. I care deeply about readable code, strong tests, and
    observability. My approach: ship small, iterate quickly, measure outcomes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Recent highlights include leading a migration from a monolith to well‑scoped
    services, improving p95 latency, and introducing CI/CD with preview
    environments and quality gates.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of feature work, I enjoy mentoring, documentation, and building
    design‑system components that make teams faster. Always learning—and always
    happy to collaborate on meaningful problems.
  </p>
